# Welcome to the ***Gradebook*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Gradebook*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'm a student, and am trying to organize my subjects, and grades, using Python. I'm exploring what Iâ€™ve learned about lists, to organize my subjects, and scores.

Even with the assistance, of having editorial control, over the numerical grades, my gradebook is EVEN WORSE, than (Mr. Blutarsky's[https://youtu.be/UKMuVFz3MOQ?si=f2ZTju5TgB5Avlw3&t=64])!ðŸ¤£

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
