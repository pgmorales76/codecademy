# Welcome to the ***Len's Slice*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Len's Slice*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I work at Lenâ€™s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood.

I'm going to use my knowledge of Python lists, to organize, some of, my sales data.

When I become owner, I'm DEFINITELY taking "[Pineapple](https://youtu.be/rKuR-1TC7s4?si=qVXbmHz1dinqXdKf&t=55)" off the toppings menu!ðŸ¤£

I've tried, and I've [DENIED](https://youtu.be/RD1KqbDdmuE?si=bqahbAYQ9kKjoJUP&t=9)!ðŸ¤£

Anything you can put in fruit salad, DOESN'T BELONG ON A PIZZA!ðŸ¤£

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
