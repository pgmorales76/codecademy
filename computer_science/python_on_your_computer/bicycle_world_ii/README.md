# Welcome to the ***Bicycle World*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Bicycle World*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I introduce you to ***Bicycle World***, the premier, text-based, bicycle shop!

This shop is, only, accessible, to programmers, like you, who are familiar, with the command line.

In this project, I use bash commands, to navigate, and edit, the filesystem of this, special, shop.

You know how, when you invite someone over, to "Netflix and chill", the goal is to "smash"?

Well, instead, of that, the goal, for programmers, is to "bash"!🤣

Perhaps, another installment, of the Bourne franchise, could be "Bourne Again SHell"?!🤣

There could be a religious version called, "Bach: Bourne Again CHristian"!🤣

Alright! I think I got, about, as much mileage, out of that, as I'm willing to go!🤣

Onto ***Bicycle World***!

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
