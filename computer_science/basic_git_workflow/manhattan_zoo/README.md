# Welcome to the ***Manhattan Zoo*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Manhattan Zoo*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I’ll use Git, to keep track of meal guidelines, for animals, at the Manhattan Zoo.

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
