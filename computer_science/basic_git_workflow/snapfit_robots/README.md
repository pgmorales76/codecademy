# Welcome to the ***SnapFit Robots, Inc.*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***SnapFit Robots, Inc.*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I’ll be using Git, to work, with assembly instruction,s for Snap-Fit Robots Inc., a build-it-yourself robot company.

["If, you'd like to know, how SnapFit gets built, the man, most-directly responsible, is Miles Bennett Dyson."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DQsG3TKQ0I)🤣

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
