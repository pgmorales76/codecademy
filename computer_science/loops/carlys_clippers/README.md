# Welcome to the ***Carly's Clippers*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Carly's Clippers*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'm the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the, newest, hair salon, on the block.

My job is to go through the lists, of data, that have been collected, in the past, couple of weeks.

I will be calculating some important metrics, Carly can use, to plan out, the operation, of the business, for the rest, of the month.

I have been provided with three lists:

1. `hairstyles`: the names, of the cuts, offered, at Carly’s Clippers.
2. `prices`: the price, of each hairstyle, in the hairstyles list.
3. `last_week`: the number of purchases, for each hairstyle type, in the last week.

Each index, in hairstyles, corresponds, to an associated index, in `prices`, and `last_week`.

For example, the hairstyle "bouffant" has an associated price of 30 from the `prices` list, and was purchased 2 times, in the last week, as shown, in the `last_week` list.

Each of these elements are in the first index, of their, respective, lists.

After leaving Carly's, you're gonna [walk in, to the party, like you're walkin onto a yacht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j13oJajXx0M)!🤣

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
