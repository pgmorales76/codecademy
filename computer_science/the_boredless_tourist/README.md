# Welcome to the ***The Boredless Tourist*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***The Boredless Tourist*** project, from Codecademy.

Welcome to ***The Boredless Tourist***, an online application, giving you the power, to find the parts, of the city, that fit, the pace of, your life.

We, at ***The Boredless Tourist***, run a recommendation engine, using Python.

We, first, evaluate what a person’s interests are, and, then, give them recommendations, in their area, to venues, restaurants, and historical destinations, that we think they’ll be engaged by.

If you've looked through, my, previous, projects, before, what you'll notice is, not only, a README, and a Python script, but, also, a text file, with bash commands, on them.

The bash file can be, a bit, confusing, only because I wasn't able to add the commands, in my IDE, as I entered them. I had to add them, after the project was finished.

Take that file, in particular, with a grain of salt. The other two, should be, perfectly, understandable.

Let’s get started!

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
