# Welcome to the ***The Boredless Tourist*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***The Boredless Tourist*** project, from Codecademy.

Welcome to ***The Boredless Tourist***, an online application, giving you the power, to find the parts, of the city, that fit, the pace of, your life.

We at ***The Boredless Tourist*** run a recommendation engine, using Python.

We, first, evaluate what a person’s interests are, and, then, give them recommendations, in their area, to venues, restaurants, and historical destinations, that we think they’ll be engaged by.

Let’s get started!

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
