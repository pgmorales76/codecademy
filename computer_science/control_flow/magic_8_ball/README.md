# Welcome to my ***Magic 8-Ball ProjectðŸŽ±!***

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Magic 8-Ball*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'll be creating a Magic 8-Ball-style program, which can answer any "Yes", or "No" (Boolean question, for us CS people!), with a different fortune, each time it executes.

Just like the, original, Magic 8-Ball, there will be twenty, different, answers, which will be selected, at random.

While there's no input on your part, this is, simply, a demonstration, of my skills, at control flow, within a Python program.

Hopefully, you'll find the Magic 8-Ball to be like Puddy, in your hands!ðŸ¤£

And, if you don't understand that joke, you may find an answer, for it, within the code!

Enjoy!

Let me know what you think!

Thanks!
