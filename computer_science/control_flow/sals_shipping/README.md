# Welcome to the ***Sal's Shipping*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Sal's Shipping*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, Iâ€™ll build a program that will take the weight of a package, and determine the cheapest way to ship it, using Salâ€™s Shippers.

The program will ask the user for the weight, of their package, and, then, tell them which method of shipping is cheapest, and how much it will cost, to ship their package, using Salâ€™s Shippers.

Sal's Shippers is the best, in the business, because Sal REALLY DOES CARE . . . about his package(s)!ðŸ¤£

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
