# ***Welcome, to my Block Letters Repository!***

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Block Letters*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'll write a Python program, which will display my initials, in block characters, to dip my toes into the world of ASCII art.

So, I guess, one could say, these will be the . . . building blocks . . . of my tech future?!ðŸ¤£

Let me know what you think!

Thanks!
