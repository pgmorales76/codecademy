# Welcome to the ***Getting Ready for Physics Class*** Project

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Getting Ready for Physics Class*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'm a physics teacher, preparing for the, upcoming, semester.

I'm going to provide my students, with functions, that will help them calculate, some, fundamental, physical properties.

While I may not be, as smart as, Mr. Clarke, I'm, just, as cool!🤣

Time, to open, that "[curiosity door](https://youtu.be/IrucTqm9ngU?si=f28Wxi8Zde-Z50vE&t=62)!"🤣

I hope you find this project interesting.

Let me know, what you think.

Thanks!
