# ***Welcome, to my Codecademy Repository!***

Hello, world!

This is my, main, repo directory, for all my projects, in Codecademy.

This repo functons, esentially, as a top-level directory, for the projects I've completed, or I'm working on, in Codecademy.

Each folder represents a career path, within Codecademy, with each sub-folder representing a section, of that career path.

Each sub-folder contains a project I'm working on, or have completed.

Apart from this, top-level, README file, each project will have its own README, telling the reader what the project sets out to accomplish.

I hope you find this repo interesing, and illustrative, of my technical skills.

Feel free to connect, with me.

Be well.

And, now, allow me to show you my incredible tech-nique!ðŸ¤£
